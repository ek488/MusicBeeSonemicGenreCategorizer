Intended for those using MusicBee with tracks tagged with RateYourMusic genres.

RYM has hundreds of genres in their database, so it can be difficult to categorize them. By doing the steps below, you can categorize most of them in MusicBee!

# Genre categories

Label most genres with their parent genre. (MusicBee has a maximum limit on number of genres you can categorize, I think the limit is some number between 1100 and 1900, so I excluded Regional Music.)

> Alternative Rock: Rock

> Art Pop: Pop

> East Coast Hip Hop: Hip Hop

> Neo-Psychedelia: Psychedelia

> Trip Hop: Electronic

> VolkstÃ¼mliche Musik: Pop

## How to (copy and paste)

1. Open "MusicBee Genre Categorisation Editor Input.txt".
2. Select all text, then copy it (ctrl + A, then ctrl + C.)
3. Open MusicBee.
4. Edit -> Edit Preferences -> Tags (2) -> group genres: Categorise....
5. Paste in the Genre Categorisation Editor.
6. Click save, then click save again.

# Virtual genre categories

Some genres belong to multiple different genre categories.

> Deconstructed Club : Dance & Electronic & Industrial Music

> Pop Rock: Pop & Rock

Unfortunately, we cannot assign a genre to more than one genre category in MusicBee. But by using a virtual tag, we can assign, for example, "Pop Rock" to separate "Pop" and "Rock" categories.

## How to (still copy and paste)

1. Open "Virtual Tag - Virtual Genre Category.txt".
2. Select all text, then copy it (ctrl + A, then ctrl + C.)
3. Open MusicBee.
4. Edit -> Edit Preferences -> Tags (1) -> group genres: Define New Tags....
5. Paste in the empty box right of "Virtual 1" and under "formula:".
6. Click save, then click save again.
